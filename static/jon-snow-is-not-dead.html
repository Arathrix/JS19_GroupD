        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxI8aPISq8I">“The past is already written, the ink is dry”</a> – so says the
            teaser for the sixth season of the popular TV show Game of Thrones. And until recently, that’s what we at <strong>got.show</strong>
            believed too. 9 long months after we saw our favourite character <strong>Jon Snow</strong> join his father up in GoT
            heaven in the season 5 finale “Mother’s Mercy” however, we have reason to believe that he’s going to stick around on
            earth with the rest of us for a little longer. You don’t think so? Well, then <strong>you know nothing, Jon
                Snow.</strong></p>

                own games</a> – that’s why we <strong>created an algorithm that calculates Game of Thrones characters’
                likeliness of death</strong>! Luckily, <strong>Jon is only at 11.6%</strong>, which is overall pretty low.
            You’ll be glad to know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton">Ramsay Bolton</a> for example is
            at over 60%! Furthermore, being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch makes him one of the safest guys in all of
            Westeros, since it is the title with the lowest death rate in the series. <a

        <p>I know, I know – being popular couldn’t save a lot of our other favourite Game of Thrones characters, but with Jon
            it’s different. Just see what an outrage the season 5 finale caused on Twitter with our Twitter Sentiment Analysis
            App – and then think about the gigantic plot twist of bringing him back to the living! &gt; Placeholder 2) Twitter
