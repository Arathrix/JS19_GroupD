<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxI8aPISq8I">“The past is already written, the ink is dry”</a> – so says the
    teaser for the sixth season of the popular TV show Game of Thrones. And until recently, that’s what we at <strong>got.show</strong>
    believed too. 9 long months after we saw our favourite character <strong>Jon Snow</strong> join his father up in GoT
    heaven in the season 5 finale “Mother’s Mercy” however, we have reason to believe that he’s going to stick around on
    earth with the rest of us for a little longer. You don’t think so? Well, then <strong>you know nothing, Jon
        Snow.</strong></p>

<p>We at <strong>got.show</strong> are firm believers that artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning can have a
    more beneficiary impact on humanity than <a

        own games</a> – that’s why we <strong>created an algorithm that calculates Game of Thrones characters’
        likeliness of death</strong>! Luckily, <strong>Jon is only at 11.6%</strong>, which is overall pretty low.
    You’ll be glad to know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton">Ramsay Bolton</a> for example is
    at over 60%! Furthermore, being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch makes him one of the safest guys in all of
    Westeros, since it is the title with the lowest death rate in the series. <a

<p>I know, I know – being popular couldn’t save a lot of our other favourite Game of Thrones characters, but with Jon
    it’s different. Just see what an outrage the season 5 finale caused on Twitter with our Twitter Sentiment Analysis

<p>I can’t even. Who’s going to care for Sam &amp; Gilly? Who will handle the wildlings? Let me tell you one thing: If

    comes to the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. Project F will be able to give you some guidelines on size &amp;

<p>Here we’ll just serve a view from ProjectD_Group4’s Twitter graph (my group). I’ve added startDate &amp; endDate
    parameters to the function that creates the graph, so you can specify the default date Range when loading the tool.
    I’d go for something around May 20 – June 20 2015 (season finale aired on June 14th)</p>
