### H1: Cersei, Jaime, Tyrion or Tommen – Who’s next to die on Game of Thrones?

Love them or hate them, but the Lannister’s sure know how to take a great family picture. So elegant, so classy – almost a little too much for a family who’s just as inbred as a sandwich, don’t you think? But let’s not drift off here! It’s apparently become tradition to kill at least one Lannister a season – First Joffrey in season 4, then Tywin & Myrcella in season 5. So with the season 6 premiere around the corner, the natural question we should ask ourselves is: Who's next?

Cersei is by far the safest of House Lannister as of now. Seems like she already had to endure enough under the High Sparrow’s thumb. [Watch her infamous walk of SHAME again on youtube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-wWaGK2bg)

#### H2: Jaime Lannister (PLACEHOLDER: % PLOD)

Jaime’s fate is really uncertain. Since he lost his arm in season 2, he’s a lot more vulnerable than he used to be. Nevertheless he’s going to seek revenge for Myrcella’s death after he had to watch her die in his arms. We’re curios what will happen next - check our PLOD machine learning algorithm for our latest predictions!

#### H2: Tyrion Lannister (PLACEHOLDER: % PLOD)

From partying to patricide, Tyrion’s plot line has been one of the most interesting ones to follow on the show – which worries us a lot, because Tyrion is universally liked (see below) and popular characters tend to face a grim future in the Game of Thrones.

Let’s hope that the Unsullied will keep him safe from the Sons of the Harpy now that he’s ruling over Meereen. We can’t wait to see him back on track!

#### H2: Tommen Baratheon (PLACEHOLDER: % PLOD)

Jackpot! With 97% predicted likelihood of death as of April 13th, Cersei & Jaime’s son is our most endangered character. Little more than a puppet to Tywin and Cersei last season, it seems like he has served his purpose now. What good is a king if he can't even prevent prevent the arrest of his own wife? Well, I'm sure he can find a new one easily. The screenwriters at HBO are probably already planning [a colourful wedding for him.]( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Red_Wedding)
