# When Theon Met Ramsay

Ahh! Theon and Ramsay, Ramsay and Theon... There used to be a time when Theon was prince and Ramsay was but a servant to that prince. Back then, Ramsay was called Reek (because he stank) and he did Theon's bidding. But all of a sudden the tables have turned on Theon and from being a self proclaimed Prince of Winterfell he was a captive at the Dreadfort, propped up to be The bastard of Bolton's personal pet. From then on Theon was Reek and Reek was Ramsay. And as Theon was sinking lower and lower (and losing some vital body parts), Ramsay was rising in the world.

Confused? well we are all confused when it comes to Ramsay and Theon. I mean, who should we hate more? Should we detest the sadistics cold bastard who turned on his friends?     or should we hate Ramsay even more? Should we hate the guy who feeds pesant girls to his hounds or the guy who burns little children and hangs their charred bodies in the castle square?

> Check out our Twittter sentiment analysis for Theon GreyJoy during the Epsiodes "The Old Gods and The New" (episode 5) and a "A Man Without Honor" (episode 6). Theon is no longer the sweetheart he used to be on twitter.

As you may remember, Theon started as a good guy, back in the first pages of GoT he was hanging out with the Starks, joinning their cause and fighting next to King Robb. But then he realized he has some unresolved daddy issues and decided that the best way to patch things with grumpy Lord Balon was to take Winterfell and capture  the North. In his path of betrayel and destrution, Theon proves to be a spineless leader, pulling a bunch of dick moves and overall turns out to be a pretty awful human being. Even in GoT standards.

So you'll get no empathy from us Theon Greyjoy, right? Enters Ramsay Snow.

Now, Ramsay is a seriously one sick motha... everyone knows that. Torture is what Ramsay does for fun and hunting peasant girls is his afternoon sports. If that's not enough, his personal favoriate activity is flaying people alive. Oh yeah, and and as the Bastard son of Roose Bolton, he also got some daddy issues - pretty serious ones!

So when these two screw ups meet you know some serious shit is about to happen. Oh and add to that the North and The Iron Islands are sworn enemies and the shit is about to get epic. For starters, Ramsay, the mafioso that he is, cuts some of Theon's skin and sends it to Robb Stark as a fake tokrn of loyalty. Then he lets Theon escape only so he can hunt him down and completely and totally crush his spirit. Theon is covered with filth as he is not allowed to bathe, everyone hates him becasue of what he did to the Starks and as a final act of humiliation he is ordered to watch while Ramsay Bolton rapes his new wife (check out our twitter senitment analysis showing the huge outrage following this rape scene).

> Check out our Ramasy Snow Twitter sentiment analysis of one of the most controversial epsiodes (Season 5 epsiode 6 "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken") in GoT history. The media was not pleased with this episode:  http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/game-of-thrones-rape-sansa-stark

At this point you're probably feeling sorry for poor Theon, right? right?? Well we here at got.show go by the old adage "The North Remebers." We remember Theon's betrayal, so ask no mercy from us Theon Greyjoy!

Our algo is also not very forgiving - in the match up between Ramsay and Theon, it is Theon who is likelier to get wiped out first. [Check out Theon's predicted likelihood of death](https://www.got.show/characters/Theon%20Greyjoy)
