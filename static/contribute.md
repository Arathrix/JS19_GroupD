WHAT IT IS

A song of Ice and Fire provides statistical information about the GoT world and the impact it has on ours. Should we be worried about Sansa Stark? Where exactly has Jon Snow travelled? And how many tweets were written about Hound?

HOW IT STARTED

Being huge machine learning nerds at [TU Munichâ€™s](https://www.tum.de/) [chair of Bioinformatics](https://rostlab.org/) and GoT fans, we wanted to use our data-crunching skills to get new insights into our beloved series (world?). We also had to prepare material for a [JavaScript seminar](https://rostlab.org/owiki/index.php/Javascript_technology_2016) that we run each semester. Long story short, we decided to let our students build this web service, improving their knowledge of JavaScript in the process!

DIVIDING TEAMS

We wanted to have in-depth description of characters, trace their travels on the map, see what other fans felt about them, and compute how much danger characters are in. So, we divided our students into several teams: 2 teams used machine learning approaches to calculate Likelihood of Death for each character, 2 teams used sentiment analysis of tweets to deduce how fans feel about GoT characters and 1 team plotted charachters' footsteps on the GoT map using data mining.

We also had 2 teams who were in charge of continuous integration of individual projects and 2 teams who assembled everything into this awesome got.show app.

OPEN SOURCE & OPEN DATA PROJECT

Our results amused and pleased us, so we decided to share our findings with the fandom!
Now it's your turn - use the data we made available and build beautiful useful apps about the GoT world!
