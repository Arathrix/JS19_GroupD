###H1: Why Daenerys Targaryen will win the Game of Thrones
Daenerys. Khaleesi. Mother of Dragons. Mhysa. There’s quite a few names for this woman – and even more reasons to be afraid of her. Ever since her father King Aerys II Targaryen was ousted from the Iron Throne during Robert Baratheon’s rebellion, she’s been desperate to take it back – and with it the control over the seven kingdoms.
Let’s face it: The moment Daenerys gave her OK for Khal Drogo to kill her (admittedly annoying) brother, we knew that girl played to win. Here’s why we’ll see here sitting on the Iron Throne soon.

####H2: She’s commanding the Unsullied

In case you want to take a city back, it is always a good idea to bring a private army. Daenerys’ has apparently done her homework on warmonger best practices and bought her very own battalion, the Unsullied, by burning their former owner alive (#justdaenerysthings).
Even with significantly less testicles or nipples compared to your average Essos man, those guys are anything and everything you could wish for when you absolutely need some people dead. Still in doubt? [See them in action.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TB3rgJlJdo&nohtml5=False)

####H2: Daenerys is the people’s woman

a)	A religious fanatic in charge of what is basically the Game of Thrones equivalent of ISIS

b)	A wimpy teenager with no experience whatsoever who should have stayed a minor character anyway

c)	A young, dynamic civil rights activist, running around Essos freeing slaves in the thousands, who’s known for her zero-tolerance policy regarding the establishment

… Who would you choose? Heh? Not so hard, right? Daenerys Targaryen is pretty much our Game of Thrones Bernie Sanders. Only in slightly more attractive. Sorry Bern.

As you can see, she’s even among the most popular characters [(rank 4, 10th of April)](link to ranking) in the real world! Feel the Daern, people!

####H2: She has a bunch of dragons

> Daenery’s pet dragon. Makes your dog look like a hamster in comparison.

… Is there a reason we’re still debating this? Seriously? Even though her lathery scaled friends started out as cute little hatchlings in season 1, those things are terrifying now. We all saw them eat the leaders of the great families in the season 5 episode “Kill the boy” (S05E05) – and as countless fantasy franchises suggest, if you have dragons by your side, chances are you’re going to bring home a victory.
