                    <p>Daenerys. Khaleesi. Mother of Dragons. Mhysa - a queen with a growing list titles and an even bigger list of reasons to take her seriously.
                        Ever since king Robert dethroned the Targaryens, she has been seeking for a way to win back the Iron Throne.
                        Let’s face it, the moment Daenerys let Drogo  kill her (admittedly annoying) brother, that's when we all knew that this young girl is 
                        playing to win. Here is why we believe that soon she will be sitting on the Iron Throne.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In case you want to take a city back, it is always a good idea to bring a private army. Daenerys has apparently done
                        her homework on warmonger best practices and bought her very own battalion - the Unsullied - by killing their former
                        owner (#justdaenerysthings). Even with significantly less testicles or nipples compared to your average Essos
                        man, those guys are anything and everything you could wish for when you absolutely need some people dead. Still in
                        doubt? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TB3rgJlJdo&amp;nohtml5=False">See them in action.</a></p>

                    <p>With the US presidential elections approaching, maybe it’s time for a small thought experiment. Imagine you could

                    <p>… Is there a reason we’re still debating this? Seriously? Even though her lathery scaled friends started out as cute
                        little hatchlings in season 1, those things are huge now. Huge! We all saw them eat the leaders of the great
                        families in the season 5 episode “Kill the boy” (S05E05) – and as countless fantasy franchises suggest, if you have
                        dragons by your side, chances are you’re going to bring home a victory.</p>
                    <h3 id="h3-sooo-things-are-set-right"> … Sooo, things are set, right?</h3>
                    <p>Well, almost. In Game of Thrones, there’s always a hint of uncertainty – and you have to admit that a lot of people
                        would like to see Daenerys disappear. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGYQr6ldJk">Just check out this attempt on
                            her life for example.</a>  While we here in the got.show editorial department are confident that she will end up being
                        victorious, our machine learning algorithm is a lot less optimistic. The algorithm mostly takes family
                        history into account, and since her family is nearly extinct, her calculated likelihood of death is pretty high.
                        See our latest prediction here: <br/> <p><img src="images/daenerys-plod.png"</p></p>
