    &gt; Daenerys Targaryen. Game of Thrones‘ mother of dragons.</p>
<h3 id="h1-why-daenerys-targaryen-will-win-the-game-of-thrones">H1: Why Daenerys Targaryen will win the Game of
    Thrones</h3>
<p>Daenerys. Khaleesi. Mother of Dragons. Mhysa. There’s quite a few names for this woman – and even more reasons to be
    afraid of her. Ever since her father King Aerys II Targaryen was ousted from the Iron Throne during Robert
    Baratheon’s rebellion, she’s been desperate to take it back – and with it the control over the seven kingdoms. Let’s
    face it: The moment Daenerys gave her OK for Khal Drogo to kill her (admittedly annoying) brother, we knew that girl
    played to win. Here’s why we’ll see here sitting on the Iron Throne soon.</p>

    The Unsullied in Game of Thrones</p>
<p>In case you want to take a city back, it is always a good idea to bring a private army. Daenerys’ has apparently done
    her homework on warmonger best practices and bought her very own battalion, the Unsullied, by burning their former
    owner alive (#justdaenerysthings). Even with significantly less testicles or nipples compared to your average Essos
    man, those guys are anything and everything you could wish for when you absolutely need some people dead. Still in
    doubt? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TB3rgJlJdo&amp;nohtml5=False">See them in action.</a></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
    <li><p>A religious fanatic in charge of what is basically the Game of Thrones equivalent of ISIS</p></li>
    <li><p>A wimpy teenager with no experience whatsoever who should have stayed a minor character anyway</p></li>
    <li><p>A young, dynamic civil rights activist, running around Essos freeing slaves in the thousands, who’s known for
        her zero-tolerance policy regarding the establishment</p></li>
</ol>
<p>… Who would you choose? Heh? Not so hard, right? Daenerys Targaryen is pretty much our Game of Thrones Bernie
    Sanders. Only in slightly more attractive. Sorry Bern.</p>

<p>As you can see, she’s even among the most popular characters <a href="link%20to%20ranking">(rank 4, 10th of
    April)</a> in the real world! Feel the Daern, people!</p>
<h4 id="h2-she-has-a-bunch-of-dragons">H2: She has a bunch of dragons</h4>
<p><img src="https://blurppy.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/game-thrones-season-4-pictures.jpg"/> &gt; Daenery’s pet
    dragon. Makes your dog look like a hamster in comparison.</p>
<p>… Is there a reason we’re still debating this? Seriously? Even though her lathery scaled friends started out as cute
    little hatchlings in season 1, those things are terrifying now. We all saw them eat the leaders of the great
    families in the season 5 episode “Kill the boy” (S05E05) – and as countless fantasy franchises suggest, if you have
    dragons by your side, chances are you’re going to bring home a victory.</p>
<h5 id="h3-sooo-things-are-set-right">H3: … Sooo, things are set, right?</h5>
<p>Well, almost. In Game of Thrones, there’s always a hint of uncertainty – and you have to admit that a lot of people
    want to see her dead. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGYQr6ldJk">Take this assassination attempt on
        youtube for example.</a> We in the got.show editorial department are confident that she’ll end up being
    victorious, even though our machine learning algorithm is a lot less optimistic. The algorithm mostly takes family
    history into account, and since her’s was cleared off the map, her calculated likelihood of death is pretty high.
