    <content>
        <p>Daenerys. Khaleesi. Mother of Dragons. Mhysa. There’s quite a few names for this woman – and even more reasons to be
            afraid of her. Ever since her father King Aerys II Targaryen was ousted from the Iron Throne during Robert
            Baratheon’s rebellion, she’s been desperate to take it back – and with it the control over the seven kingdoms. Let’s
            face it: The moment Daenerys gave her OK for Khal Drogo to kill her (admittedly annoying) brother, we knew that girl
            played to win. Here’s why we’ll see here sitting on the Iron Throne soon.</p>

            The Unsullied in Game of Thrones</p>
        <p>In case you want to take a city back, it is always a good idea to bring a private army. Daenerys’ has apparently done
            her homework on warmonger best practices and bought her very own battalion, the Unsullied, by burning their former
            owner alive (#justdaenerysthings). Even with significantly less testicles or nipples compared to your average Essos
            man, those guys are anything and everything you could wish for when you absolutely need some people dead. Still in
            doubt? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TB3rgJlJdo&amp;nohtml5=False">See them in action.</a></p>

        <p>… Who would you choose? Heh? Not so hard, right? Daenerys Targaryen is pretty much our Game of Thrones Bernie
            Sanders. Only in slightly more attractive. Sorry Bern.</p>

        <p>As you can see, she’s even among the most popular characters <a href="link%20to%20ranking">(rank 4, 10th of
            April)</a> in the real world! Feel the Daern, people!</p>

            dragon. Makes your dog look like a hamster in comparison.</p>
        <p>… Is there a reason we’re still debating this? Seriously? Even though her lathery scaled friends started out as cute
            little hatchlings in season 1, those things are terrifying now. We all saw them eat the leaders of the great
            families in the season 5 episode “Kill the boy” (S05E05) – and as countless fantasy franchises suggest, if you have
            dragons by your side, chances are you’re going to bring home a victory.</p>
        <h3 id="h3-sooo-things-are-set-right">H3: … Sooo, things are set, right?</h3>
        <p>Well, almost. In Game of Thrones, there’s always a hint of uncertainty – and you have to admit that a lot of people
            want to see her dead. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGYQr6ldJk">Take this assassination attempt on
                youtube for example.</a> We in the got.show editorial department are confident that she’ll end up being
            victorious, even though our machine learning algorithm is a lot less optimistic. The algorithm mostly takes family
            history into account, and since her’s was cleared off the map, her calculated likelihood of death is pretty high.
