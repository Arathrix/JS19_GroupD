# Why Jon Snow is not dead

“The past is already written, the ink is dry” – so says the teaser for the sixth season of the popular TV show Game of Thrones. And until recently, that’s what we at got.show believed too. It was nine long months ago, dudring the season five finale (“Mother’s Mercy”) that we saw our favorite character Jon Snow join his father in GoT heaven however.

# When Theon Met Ramsay
Ahh! Theon and Ramsay, Ramsay and Theon... There used to be a time when Theon was prince and Ramsay was but a servant to that prince. Back then, Ramsay was called Reek (because he stank) and he did Theon's bidding. But, all of a sudden, the tables have turned on Theon and from being a self-proclaimed Prince of Winterfell, he was a captive at the Dreadfort, propped up to be The bastard of Bolton's personal pet.
