             <h1>Season Six Episode Two - Home - A got.show Recap</h1>
            <p>Episode 2 is here and this time it takes us far away from Dorne, beyond the Wall and into the Lands of Always Winter, where we find <a href="https://got.show/characters/Bran%20Stark">Bran Stark</a> all grown up after his season-five hiatus. Under the mentorship of the Three-eyed Raven, Bran has improved his warging skills as well as his Greensight. In his visions, Bran time travels forty years back to Winterfell where we discover that young Eddard was never really good at protecting himself and that speaking Hodor&rsquo;s real name is Wyllis.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Quite a cosy place compared to nowadays occupied Winterfell where Ramsay&rsquo;s plans of inheriting Roose Bolton and becoming the Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North have been baffled by</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>&hellip; a baby. The new true-born son and legal heir that Fat Walda had just brought to life burst Ramsay&rsquo;s bubble and being the total bastard that he is, he ended the family idyll by striking a dagger &nbsp;through his unsuspecting father&rsquo;s heart. And how could have Roose suspected anything - we assigned him a <strong>predicted likelihood of death of only 28%</strong>. We also did not see <a href="https://got.show/characters/Walda%20Frey%20%28daughter%20of%20Merrett%29">Fat Walda&rsquo;s</a> horrifying death coming - her <strong>PLoD was at 19%</strong>.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>But let&rsquo;s leave Ramsay whistle his cares away and switch to something less gruesome by jumping over to Essos where we find that life without your Khalessi can be quite boring and with the help of some wine may lead to talking to dragons and setting them free - and all that without turning into a burning torch in the process. So well done Tyrion and thank you for releasing Viserion and Rhaegal from their chains.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Continuing with the good news over at Castle Black - it seems like Jon had more friends than enemies in the Night&rsquo;s Watch. No doubt Sir Alistair Thorne was very happy to see the wildlings coming back&hellip; &nbsp;as well as the inside of the cell they put him in. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>But guess who else came back - that&rsquo;s right world, you can relax now, Jon Snow is alive and kicking&hellip; or at least breathing heavily. So it turns out that the storyline of everyone&rsquo;s favourite Lord Commander is not over, as we have told <a class="c4" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/19/game-of-thrones-algorithm-jon-snow-death">The Guardian</a>. We <strong>predicted his resurrection due to his PLoD of only 11%</strong>, so we believed more strongly into Melisandre's abilities than she did herself. As you see, algorithms are far more reliable than the Lord of Light! By the way, did you know that as the episode aired and Jon Snow got resurrected, the orthodox world was celebrating Eastern? Maybe the producers are trying to tell us something&hellip; In any case, it was definitely a breath of fresh air!</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>Season six is finally here and so our watch begins. It seems like Westeros is still the same batshit crazy, stinky, fanatic, murderous, and exciting show in town! Stay tuned for news from Castle Black, but first let's hop over to Dorne
              where clueless <a
                href="/characters/Doran%2520Martell">

              Sand</a> Well, we definitely knew that Doran is unlikely to survive for long - his
            Predicted Likelihood of Death (PLoD) was at 82%, which means he should&rsquo;ve
              watched his back (or front) instead of gazing into the nothing..</p>
            <p><span>&hellip; And of course a full-on coup cannot be complete without killing off the heir apparent. </span><span

              Martell</a></span><span>&nbsp;was about to embark on a cruise when all of a sudden two of the Sand Snakes confronted him with the existential question &ldquo;which one of us should kill you?&rdquo;
              Had </span><span>Trystane </span><span>checked our prediction ahead of time he would have known that he didn&rsquo;t stand a chance, his </span><span
            >PLoD was at 90%</span><span>&nbsp;anyway. With the departure of Doran and Trystane the Martell&rsquo;s are about to lose their grip over Dorne. &nbsp;</span>
            </p>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <p><span>Meanwhile, Jamie comes back from Dorne with yet another dead Lannister child. In her grief, Cersei reveals to Jaime that she knew all along that none of her kids will survive after she visited the got.show website. Since Cersey is living in a pseudo-medieval world she replaced &ldquo;machine learning algorithm&rdquo;
              with &ldquo;witch&rdquo; and &ldquo;prediction&rdquo; with &ldquo;prophecy&rdquo; but we all know what she really meant. Don&#39;t we? At any rate, </span><span>Now that the other Baratheon kids are gone, it doesn&#39;t look well for </span><span

              href="/characters/Eddison%2520Tollett">Edd</a></span><span>&nbsp;reached over and closed Jon&rsquo;s eye lids - don&rsquo;t think for a moment that Jon&rsquo;s storyline is over! As the sea bear put it: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always the red woman.&rdquo;
              Or whatever that thing is</span><span>.</span></p>

            <p>P.S.</p>
            <p>We gotta admit our first miss as well - <a

                 Hotah</a>, Doran&rsquo;s faithful body guard was taken out. Poor Areo didn&#39;t know what was coming, he was probably happy to see that his
            PLoD was at 36% and so he felt kinda safe. Well, Areo, you know what they say about being complacent...
