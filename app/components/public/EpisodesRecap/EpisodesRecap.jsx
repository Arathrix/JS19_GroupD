            <p>Season six is finally here and so our watch begins. It seems like Westeros is still the same batshit crazy, stinky, fanatic, murderous, and exciting show in town! Stay tuned for news from Castle Black, but first let's hop over to Dorne

              Sand</a> Well, we definitely knew that Doran is unlikely to survive for long - his
            Predicted Likelihood of Death (PLoD) was at 82%, which means he should&rsquo;ve
              watched his back (or front) instead of gazing into the nothing..</p>

            <p><span>Meanwhile, Jamie comes back from Dorne with yet another dead Lannister child. In her grief, Cersei reveals to Jaime that she knew all along that none of her kids will survive after she visited the got.show website. Since Cersey is living in a pseudo-medieval world she replaced &ldquo;machine learning algorithm&rdquo;
              with &ldquo;witch&rdquo; and &ldquo;prediction&rdquo; with &ldquo;prophecy&rdquo; but we all know what she really meant. Don&#39;t we? At any rate, </span><span>Now that the other Baratheon kids are gone, it doesn&#39;t look well for </span><span
