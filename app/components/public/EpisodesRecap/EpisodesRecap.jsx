            <h1>Season six Episode Six - Blood of My Blood - A got.show Recap</h1>
            <p>No one dies in episode 6. Not Bran and Meera, who were still chased by the walkers army that took Hodor
              away from us in episode 5. Bran and Meera got saved by a masked rider, named “Cold Hands” in the books,
              who turned out to be fearless Benjen Stark (we predicted his PLOD at 93%). </p>
            <img src={benjen}/>
            <p> Benjen was suppose to die at the hands of a Wight, but he himself was saved by the Children. You know
              who else did not die? The thousands of people crowding to see Margery’s walk of shame. They were pressed
              between a Tyrell army and the Militants - a standoff that promises rivers of blood - yet, in a last minute
              plotline twist, the Faith and Crown announced peace and everyone walked home happily. Well, almost
              everyone -- Jaime Lannister, who also did not die this episode was sent to a sort of exile in the
              Riverlands. Sam Tarly also managed to not die, although his douche dad tried to kill him with insults.
              Even Arya’s hit job on an actress got called off in the last minute, leaving us with, you guessed it -
              another not-dead character.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Hello dear readers and GoT fans! Another week passed and a lot has happened in the realm.</p>
            <p>Episode 5 takes us back to Castle Black, where Sansa receives an unexpected message from the devil
              himself, Petyr Baelish, and even agrees to meet him at Mole‘s Town. It seems the North does indeed
              remember after Sansa confronts Littlefinger about her arranged marriage with the monster Ramsey. But does
              it also remember Lord Baelish is not to be trusted? Hard to say after Sansa’s little lie to Jon about how
              she knows that her uncle, Brynden the Blackfish, has retaken Riverrun and gathered an army. No wonder Jon
              Snow knows nothing if even his family doesn’t tell him anything. Let’s just hope Little Finger’s new move
              on the Game of Thrones chess board doesn’t end up bad for the Starks, especially when they are heading
              towards war to take Winterfell back.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Arya Stark gets her promised second chance to make up for
              stealing from the many-faced God. Her assignment, however, is very interesting – she gets to assassinate
              Cersei Lannister… Well, in a way, at least. Shortly after giving back her sight, Jaqen H'ghar gives Arya
              the task of killing an actress that plays Cersei in a comedy mocking king Robert’s death, as well as Ned
              Stark by portraying him as a fool. Not that Ned’s decisions in King’s Landing weren’t foolish, at the end
              they even cost him his head. However, the Lord of Winterfell and the Hand of the King was a man of honor
              and not a clown. Whether it was the mockery about her father or maybe it was seeing Ned’s head being
              chopped off again, one thing is certain – this was definitely not the play you want to see shortly after
              getting your sight back, especially if you are Arya Stark… oops sorry, no one, especially when you are no
              one.</p>
            <p>And from one Stark to another – let’s pay Bran a visit in his tree house and see what he has been up to.
              Just as usual, Bran and his mentor have been jumping back in time in order to learn everything. This time,
              we witness the creation of the white walkers and - brace yourselves – these were the Children of the
              Forest who made them. To Bran’s surprise, Leaf, the only one of the Children of the Forest who speaks
              Common Tongue of Westeros, tells him that the white walkers were created to defend the children of the
              forest from … men, the First Men, but still men.</p>
            <p>
              The journey through the white walkers history continues as bored Bran decides to go for a time walk alone.
              The path takes him to the very same place – the weirwood tree above the cave, where he sees the Night King
              and his army – this time, also the Night King sees Bran and even tries to shake hands with him. The
              friendly gesture ends up as a mark on Bran’s arm and an invitation for the Night King to join Bran in his
              cozy little hideout, since now the protective magic of the cave doesn’t work anymore.
            </p><p>
              As Meera Reed, the Children of the Forest and the direwolf Summer fight off the white walkers marching
              into the cave, the three-eyed raven takes Bran back to Winterfell for one last history lesson. While still
              in Winterfell, Bran listens to the voice of Meera from the present and wargs into Wyllis, the young
              version of Hodor, finally getting them on the run after his direwolf and the Children of the Forest die
              defending them. As the door to the Land of Always Winter gets closer and closer, so does the revealing
              moment when past and future collide, turning young Willis in Hodor. As we witness Hodor’s tremendous
              sacrifice to „HO…ld the… DoOR“ and the white walkers, Bran watches Wyllis convulsing (we predicted his
              likelihood of death of 52%) in Winterfell in one of the most emotional and touching scenes in the series
              so far.
              Oh Hodor, the fandom remembers!

            </div>
            <br/> <p>
              Two weeks have passed since our last recap and we bet you guys missed us like Missandei and Co have been
              missing their queen. Well, just like Daenerys, we decided to get on a more hipster version of a Dragon and
              head to Luxembourg to kick some ass at the <a href="http://morpheuscup.com">Morpheus Cup 2016</a>. And oh
              do we have news! <a href="http://got.show">Got.show</a> won the best coding project award and we nailed
              the coding and design challenges! So, big thank you goes to Google Summer of Code, TU München, E&m
              Makeover and our two anonymous sponsors that helped us attending the competition and win (almost) all
              prizes they had!
            </p><p>
              But back to Westeros! After the worldwide celebrations of <b>Jon Snow</b> being alive, just as we
              predicted (his <b>likelihood of death - PLOD - equals only 11%</b>), episode 3 starts off in Castle Black.
              There, Jon seems to be quite surprised himself finding out that he is back to life. But then again, he
              knows nothing, and probably everything comes as surprise to him.
            </p>
            <img src={jon}/> <p>
              So, let's give him some time to adjust and jump over to Meereen and the guy who knows everything - Lord
              Varys. He makes Vala an offer that she cannot refuse and finds out who finances the Sons of the harpies.
              We still suspect that his little birds are actually our twitter sentiments, but we are going to let that
              slide in the name of the realm.
            </p><p>
              Off to our next stop, where we take another history lesson from the greenseer together with Bran. There,
              we get to see young Ned Stark in a completely different light, that being the light of the Sword of the
              Morning, Sir Arthur Dayne. Unlike the story Bran has heard a thousand times, it turns out that Ned was
              overpowered by the legendary knight and managed to kill him only because one of his companions stabbed Sir
              Arthur in the back. So, why did Ned lie about killing Sir Arthur and what else is Ned hiding (in that
              tower)? Next time we see him, we will talk about it, we promise!
            </p><p>
              And speaking of seeing things differently... or at all - Arya Stark has finally become no one and got her
              sight back. So, the Starks seem to be finally catching a break ... well, aside from Rickon. Episode 3
              leaves us in the great hall of Winterfell, where the Karstarks have caught Osha and Rickon, and killed his
              darewolf. Don't you just hate it when a darewolf is killed?
            </p><p>
              Well, at least Ghost seems to be safe near Jon Snow, but for how long? Jon’s decision to leave the Night's
              Watch seems perfectly timed with Sansa’s arrival at Castle Black, as well as with her plans of taking back
              Winterfell. Seems like her idea found supporters even among the wildlings, so we all hope that, as episode
              5 comes, we will see a Stark reunion and not the evil things on Ramsay's wish list from the threat message
              he sent to Jon demanding the return of his beloved wife.
            </p><p>
              Speaking of Ramsay, he added one more victim to his list by killing Osha. Something we have to thank Theon
              for, since he was the one telling Ramsay it was her who helped the Stark boys to escape. But let’s not
              forget that, on the other hand, Theon helped Sansa to escape by killing Ramsay’s girlfriend Myranda. So,
              Theon has also some good deeds and might be leaving Reek in peace and transforming back to Theon Greyjoy,
              whom we find in Pyke, offering his help to his sister Asha in becoming the ruler of the Iron Islands.
            </p><p>
              On the other side of Westeros, things seem to be tightening up, as Queen Margaery and her brother are
              still locked in the Sept of Baelor. We finally get to see Loras, or at least what is left of him, as
              Margaery is allowed to see him. The once mighty Knight of the Flowers seems to have faded away instead of
              growing strong as the Tyrell’s House words decree. Will Loras succeed and stay strong or will the high
              sparrow win this battle?

              Now, let’s hop over to Vaes Dothrak and see how the other queen rescue operation is going. We find Jorah
              Mormont and Daario Naharis sneaking into the holy city of Dothraki to save Daenerys. Khal Moro and his
              men’s discussions on whether to trade Daenerys for livestock seem to bore the Mother of Dragons. So, she
              decides to heathen things up a bit. As the Dothraki temple burns down, the citizens of Vaes Dothrak gather
              to witness how a Targaryen throws a barbeque party and to salute their new queen. Talk about setting up
              the roof on fire and dynamic threes ;-)

            </div>
            <br/><p>Episode 2 is here and this time it takes us far away from Dorne, beyond the Wall and into the Lands
              of Always Winter, where we find <a href="https://got.show/characters/Bran%20Stark">Bran Stark</a> all
              grown up after his season-five hiatus. Under the mentorship of the Three-eyed Raven, Bran has improved his
              warging skills as well as his Greensight. In his visions, Bran time travels forty years back to Winterfell
              where we discover that young Eddard was never really good at protecting himself and that speaking
              Hodor&rsquo;s real name is Wyllis.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Quite a cosy place compared to nowadays occupied Winterfell where Ramsay&rsquo;s plans of inheriting
              Roose Bolton and becoming the Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North have been baffled by</p>
            <p />
            <p>&hellip; a baby. The new true-born son and legal heir that Fat Walda had just brought to life burst
              Ramsay&rsquo;s bubble and being the total bastard that he is, he ended the family idyll by striking a
              dagger &nbsp;through his unsuspecting father&rsquo;s heart. And how could have Roose suspected anything -
              we assigned him a <strong>predicted likelihood of death of only 28%</strong>. We also did not see <a
                href="https://got.show/characters/Walda%20Frey%20%28daughter%20of%20Merrett%29">Fat Walda&rsquo;s</a>
              horrifying death coming - her <strong>PLoD was at 19%</strong>.</p>
            <p />
            <p>But let&rsquo;s leave Ramsay whistle his cares away and switch to something less gruesome by jumping over
              to Essos where we find that life without your Khalessi can be quite boring and with the help of some wine
              may lead to talking to dragons and setting them free - and all that without turning into a burning torch
              in the process. So well done Tyrion and thank you for releasing Viserion and Rhaegal from their
              chains.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Continuing with the good news over at Castle Black - it seems like Jon had more friends than enemies in
              the Night&rsquo;s Watch. No doubt Sir Alistair Thorne was very happy to see the wildlings coming
              back&hellip; &nbsp;as well as the inside of the cell they put him in. </p>
            <p />
            <p>But guess who else came back - that&rsquo;s right world, you can relax now, Jon Snow is alive and
              kicking&hellip; or at least breathing heavily. So it turns out that the storyline of everyone&rsquo;s
              favourite Lord Commander is not over, as we have told <a className="c4"
                                                                       href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/19/game-of-thrones-algorithm-jon-snow-death">The
                Guardian</a>. We <strong>predicted his resurrection due to his PLoD of only 11%</strong>, so we believed
              more strongly into Melisandre's abilities than she did herself. As you see, algorithms are far more
              reliable than the Lord of Light! By the way, did you know that as the episode aired and Jon Snow got
              resurrected, the orthodox world was celebrating Eastern? Maybe the producers are trying to tell us
              something&hellip; In any case, it was definitely a breath of fresh air!</p>
