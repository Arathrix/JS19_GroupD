            <p>Ahh! Theon and Ramsay, Ramsay and Theon... There used to be a time when Theon was prince and Ramsay was but a servant
                to that prince. Back then, Ramsay was called Reek (because he stank) and he did Theon's bidding. But, all of a
                sudden, the tables have turned on Theon and from being a self-proclaimed Prince of Winterfell, he was a captive at
                the Dreadfort, propped up to be The bastard of Bolton's personal pet. From then on, Theon was Reek and Reek was
                Ramsay. And as Theon was sinking lower and lower (and losing some vital body parts), Ramsay was rising in the
                world.</p>

            <p>Confused? Well, we are all confused when it comes to Ramsay and Theon. I mean, who should we hate more? Should we
                detest the sadistic cold bastard who turned on his friends? Or should we hate Ramsay even more? Should we hate the
                guy who feeds peasant girls to his hounds or the guy who burns little children and hangs their charred bodies in the
                castle square?</p>

                    alt="theon twitter sentiment analysis"/> &gt; Check out our Twittter sentiment analysis for Theon Greyjoy during
                the Epsiodes &quot;The Old Gods and The New&quot; (Season 5, Episode 5) and a &quot;A Man Without Honor&quot;
                (Season 5, Episode 6). Theon is no longer the sweetheart he used to be on Twitter.</p>
            <p>As you may remember, Theon started as a good guy, back in the first pages of GoT, he was hanging out with the Starks,
                joining their cause and fighting next to King Robb. But then, he realized he has some unresolved daddy issues and
                decided that the best way to patch things with grumpy Lord Balon was to take Winterfell and capture the North. In
                his path of betrayal and destruction, Theon proves to be a spineless leader, pulling a bunch of dick moves and
                overall turns out to be a pretty awful human being. Even in GoT standards.</p>

            <p>So you'll get no empathy from us Theon Greyjoy, right?</p>
            <p>Enters Ramsay Snow.</p>
            <p>Now, Ramsay is a seriously sick motha... everyone knows that. Torture is what Ramsay does for fun and hunting peasant
                girls is his afternoon sports. If that's not enough, his personal favorite activity is flaying people alive. Oh
                yeah, and as the Bastard son of Roose Bolton, he also got some daddy issues - pretty serious ones!</p>

            <p>So when these two screw ups meet, you know some serious shit is about to happen. Oh and add to that, the North and
                The Iron Islands are sworn enemies and the shit is about to get epic. For starters, Ramsay, the mafioso that he is,
                cuts some of Theon's skin and sends it to Robb Stark as a fake token of loyalty. Then he lets Theon escape, only so
                he can hunt him down and completely and totally crush his spirit. Theon is covered with filth as he is not allowed
                to bathe, everyone hates him because of what he did to the Starks and as a final act of humiliation he is ordered to
                watch while Ramsay Bolton rapes his new wife (check out our Twitter sentiment analysis showing the huge outrage
                following this rape scene).</p>

                Check out our Ramasy Snow Twitter sentiment analysis of one of the most controversial epsiodes (Season 5, Epsiode 6
                &quot;Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken&quot;) in GoT history. The media was not pleased with this episode:
                http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/game-of-thrones-rape-sansa-stark</p>
            <p>At this point you're probably feeling sorry for poor Theon, right? Right?? Well, we here at got.show go by the old
                adage &quot;The North Remembers.&quot; We remember Theon's betrayal, so ask no mercy from us Theon Greyjoy!</p>
            <p>Our algo is also not very forgiving - in the matchup between Ramsay and Theon, it is Theon who is likelier to get
                wiped out first. <a href="https://www.got.show/characters/Theon%20Greyjoy">Check out Theon's predicted likelihood of
